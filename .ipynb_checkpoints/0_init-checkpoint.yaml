# Settings USED FOR READING TXTS

# yes_readEntireFolder == 1:
#   will read all files in a queryname folder inside the raw
#   this is the recommended way now


  # file structure should look like this:
  # pwd / raws / subject

  # pwd +
  #     |____raws +
  #               |____<query name> +
  #                                 |____ <all txt files of a query>.txt

  # because a query may contain many txt files, that's why we need to have a
  # <query name> folder to contain all txt files

#     this folder needs to be in 'raws'
#     this folder will carry the name of the query
#     all txts in the folder will be read in the sequenece of time modified
#     all txts in the folder will be renamed "queryname_part##.txt"

# yes_readEntireFolder == 0:
#     this option is for really short period of historian data that all fits in one file
#     will read all part files related to filename in folder 'raws'
#     or will just read one file if the filename doesn't have '_part#'


# if NOT yes_readEntireFolder:
  # copy paste one of the _part.txt's filename here
  # the code will determine all other part files.

# if yes_readEntireFolder:
# specify the queryname folder inside the "raws" folder

# if read entire folder, then auto change filenames by datemodified
# potential problem when we want to rearrange the order
# only rename file if "_part#" is NOT present

###########################################################################
# the following is ONLY USED FOR data2excel and plotting

# specify Pickle file to read
#     no matter how you specified the txt files to read, all data will
#     be pickled into the pickles folder

#     plotting or converting to exel will find the pickled files in "pickles"
